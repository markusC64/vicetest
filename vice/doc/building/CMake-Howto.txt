Building VICE with CMake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to build VICE using CMake.

First configure the VICE sources as though you were going to build normally. Do
this in-tree as it won't work via an external build folder. Then run a script to
generate the CMakeLists.txt files from the Makefiles:

$ ./configure <whatever configure arguments>
$ ./cmake-bootsrap.sh

Then create a build folder for the CMake build, then cd to that folder. You can
now use CMake generate a build system:

$ cmake <path to vice source folder>
$ make -j

Things get more interesting when you generate a different project type, for
example, to generate an Xcode project that can build and debug VICE:

$ cmake -G Xcode <path to vice source folder>
$ open VICE.xcodeproj

Invoke CMake help to see the project generators installed on your system:

$ cmake --help
