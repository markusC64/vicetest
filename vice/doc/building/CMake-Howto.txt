Building VICE with CMake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to build VICE using CMake. Makefiles generated by CMake are
capable of greater parallelism with make -j than the autotools ones. You can
shave a second or two off the build time using ninja as well.

Configure the VICE sources with --enable-cmake. Do this in-tree as it won't work
via an external build folder.

$ ./configure --enable-cmake <whatever configure arguments>

Then create a build folder for the CMake build, then cd to that folder. You can
now use CMake generate a build system:

$ cmake <path to vice source folder>
$ make -j

Things get more interesting when you generate a different project type, for
example, to generate an Xcode project that can build and debug VICE:

$ cmake -G Xcode <path to vice source folder>
$ open VICE.xcodeproj

Invoke CMake help to see the project generators installed on your system:

$ cmake --help
